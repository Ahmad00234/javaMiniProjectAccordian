        <h4>1. What is JavaScript?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          A high-level, interpreted programming language called JavaScript makes
          it possible to create interactive web pages and online apps with
          dynamic functionality. Commonly referred to as the universal language,
          Javascript is primarily used by developers for front-end and back-end
          work.

        <h4>2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          JavaScript has six primitive data types:
          <br />
          1. Number
          <br />
          2. String
          <br />
          3. Boolean
          <br />
          4. Null
          <br />
          5. Undefined
          <br />
          6. Symbol
          <br /><br />
          It also has two compound data types:
          <br />
          1. Object
          <br />
          2. Array

        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Hoisting is a JavaScript concept that refers to the process of moving
          declarations to the top of their scope. This means that variables and
          functions can be used before they are declared, as long as they are
          declared before they are used in a function.
          <br />
          For example, the following code will print "Hello, world!" even though
          the greeting variable is not declared until after the console.log()
          statement.

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          null is an assignment value that represents no value or an empty
          value, while undefined is a variable that has been declared but not
          assigned a value.

      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The this keyword refers to the object that is executing the current
          function or method. It allows access to object properties and methods
          within the context of that object.

          6. What is the difference between == and === operators in JavaScript?
        </h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The equality == operator is a comparison operator that compares two
          values and returns true if they are equal. The strict equality ===
          operator is also a comparison operator, but it compares two values and
          returns true only if they are equal and of the same type.
          <br />
          For example, the following code will return true, because the values
          of the x and y variables are equal.

          7.What is the difference between “var” and “let” keywords in
          JavaScript?
        </h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          The var and let keywords are both used to declare variables in
          JavaScript. However, there are some key differences between the two
          keywords.
          <br />
          The var keyword declares a global variable, which means that the
          variable can be accessed from anywhere in the code. The let keyword
          declares a local variable, which means that the variable can only be
          accessed within the block of code where it is declared.

        <h4>8. What are closures in JavaScript?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Closures (closureFn) are functions that have access to variables from
          an outer function even after the outer function has finished
          executing. They “remember” the environment in which they were created.

        <h4>9. What is implicit type coercion in JavaScript?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Implicit type coercion is a JavaScript concept that refers to the
          automatic conversion of a value from one type to another. In
          JavaScript, this conversion follows a priority order that typically
          begins with strings, then numbers, and finally booleans. If you try to
          add a string to a number, JavaScript will implicitly coerce the number
          to a string before performing the addition operation because strings
          have the highest priority in type coercion.
          <br />
          For example, when you combine the number 5 with the string '10' using
          the addition operator, the result is the string '510'. This occurs
          because JavaScript will implicitly convert the number 5 to a string
          following the priority of coercion, and then concatenate it to the
          string '10'.

        <h4>10.How can you clone an object in JavaScript?</h4>
        <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
      </div>

      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          There are multiple ways to clone an object in JavaScript. One common
          method is using the Object.assign() method or the spread operator
          (...).
